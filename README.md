# WokeScript
WokeScript is a programming language that prioritizes social justice and inclusivity. It aims to provide a programming environment that is not offensive to anyone or anything.

## Installation
WokeScript is designed to run only on hardware that consents to running it. To install, make sure your hardware is woke enough and then run:

```bash
npm install -g wokescript
```
## Usage
WokeScript code can be written in any text editor and saved with the `.wks` extension. To run a WokeScript program, use the `woke` command followed by the name of the file:

```bash
woke myprogram.wks
```

## Syntax
WokeScript has a unique syntax that reflects its values. Here are some examples:

### Variable declaration
In WokeScript, every variable must start with the keyword `woke`.

```javascript
woke var x = 10;
woke let y = 20;
woke const z = 30;
```

### Control flow
The "if-else" keywords are offensive in WokeScript, so we use `whenever` and `otherwise` instead.

```javascript
// Traditional if-else statement
if (x > y) {
  doSomething();
} else {
  doSomethingElse();
}

// WokeScript version
whenever (x > y) {
  doSomething();
} otherwise {
  doSomethingElse();
}
```

The "try-catch" keywords are also problematic, so we use `attempt` and `arrest` instead.

```javascript
// Traditional try-catch statement
try {
  doSomethingThatMightThrowAnError();
} catch (error) {
  handleTheError();
}

// WokeScript version
attempt {
  doSomethingThatMightThrowAnError();
} arrest (error) {
  handleTheError();
}
```

### Loops
Looping is inclusive in WokeScript and is achieved by the `considering` keyword.

```javascript
// Traditional for loop
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  doSomethingWith(array[i]);
}

// WokeScript version
considering (woke let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  doSomethingWith(array[i]);
}
```

### Error handling
In WokeScript, we don't "throw an error" â€“ we "throw a tantrum".

```javascript
woke function divide(dividend, divisor) {
  if (divisor === 0) {
    throwTantrum("Cannot divide by zero!");
  }
  return dividend / divisor;
}
```

### Sensitivity
In WokeScript, every variable is considered sensitive and must be treated accordingly. Gender pronouns are not allowed in variable names or string literals.

### Additional functionality
WokeScript includes a `trigger` keyword that allows you to create triggered functions.

```javascript
woke function myTriggeredFunction() {
  trigger myEvent;
  doSomething();
}

woke function myEventHandler() {
  when myEvent maybe {
    doSomethingElse();
  }
}
```

### Inequity operator
The "inequity" operator works similarly to the inequality operator, but with a more nuanced meaning. While the inequality operator simply checks if two values are not equal, the "inequity" operator also takes into account issues of systemic inequality and privilege.

For example, if a developer were to write the following code:
```javascript
if (user.role ~= "admin") {
  // do something
}
```

This would signal that the developer is aware of the potential power dynamics at play in the comparison, and is taking steps to ensure that their code is as inclusive and equitable as possible.
Ultimately, the goal would be to promote empathy, understanding, and inclusivity in programming practices.

## WokeScript Ecosystem

Our tool chain is carefully crafted to ensure that it aligns with our WokeScript values and principles. Here's a rundown of the tools we use:

### WokeBuild

WokeBuild is our build system of choice. It uses a complex algorithm to determine if the code being built is sufficiently Woke, and if it's not, it will refuse to build the code.

### WokeLint

WokeLint is our linter. It analyzes your code for any language that could be considered offensive or insensitive. If it finds any issues, it will provide a helpful suggestion on how to fix it.

### WokeTest

WokeTest is our testing framework. It includes a variety of tests designed to ensure that your code is Woke enough. It includes tests for gender neutrality, cultural sensitivity, and more.

### WokeDeploy

WokeDeploy is our deployment tool. It ensures that the code being deployed is Woke and has been thoroughly tested. It also includes a feature that checks the hardware architecture of the machine it's being deployed to, to ensure that it's a Woke-friendly architecture.

### WokePackage

WokePackage is our package manager. It only allows the installation of Woke packages that have been thoroughly vetted for their Wokeness. Any package that is found to be insufficiently Woke will not be allowed to be installed.

### WokeIDE

WokeIDE is our integrated development environment. It provides a friendly and Woke environment for developers to write their code in. It includes helpful features such as auto-correct for insensitive language, and a Wokeness score for your code.

### WokeDocs

WokeDocs is our documentation tool. It automatically generates documentation for your code, without using any language that could be considered patronizing or condescending. 

## WokeScript Toolchain

- Transpiler: The **wokec** transpiler compiles WokeScript code to JavaScript. Use the `--js` flag to compile to JavaScript.

- Linter: The **wokelint** linter checks your WokeScript code for microaggressions and micro-inclusions. Use the `--fix` flag to automatically fix issues.

- Formatter: The **wokefmt** formatter reformats your code to be more socially just. Use the `--dry-run` flag to see what changes would be made.

- Privilege Checker: The **wokepriv** privilege checker identifies and flags privileged code. Use the `--enable-privilege-checker` flag to enable this feature.

- Microaggression Detector: The **wokemicro** microaggression detector flags code that could be potentially harmful. Use the `--enable-microaggression-detector` flag to enable this feature.

- Micro-inclusion Scanner: The **wokemicron** micro-inclusion scanner ensures that all code is equally represented. Use the `--enable-micro-inclusion-scanner` flag to enable this feature.

- Social Justice Analysis: The **wokesocial** social justice analyzer ensures that your code is promoting social justice. Use the `--enable-social-justice-analyzer` flag to enable this feature.

- Safe Space Enforcer: The **wokesafe** safe space enforcer ensures that all code is safe for everyone. Use the `--enable-safe-space-enforcer` flag to enable this feature.

*Note: All of our tools are designed to be inclusive and welcoming to all developers, regardless of their background or level of experience.*

## Community
The WokeScript community is committed to inclusivity and equality. We welcome developers of all backgrounds and identities, as long as they uphold our values. We do not provide documentation, as it may be seen as patronizing or "mansplaining". Instead, we encourage everyone to educate themselves on WokeScript and its principles.

## Contributors
WokeScript was created by [Your Name Here] and is maintained by a team of passionate activists and developers. We are always looking for new contributors who share our vision of a more

## Documentation
In WokeScript, we believe in empowering our users to discover the language on their own terms, without relying on traditional forms of documentation. We recognize that traditional documentation can be patronizing and may perpetuate harmful power dynamics, such as mansplaining.

Instead, we encourage users to experiment with the language and explore its capabilities through trial and error. We believe that this approach fosters a deeper understanding and connection with the language, and helps users to develop their own unique coding style.

That being said, we do provide a range of resources to support users in their coding journey. These resources include a community forum where users can connect and share ideas, a range of video tutorials and workshops hosted by our team of experienced coders, and a comprehensive set of code examples that demonstrate the language's capabilities.

We believe that these resources, in combination with our intuitive and sensitive language design, will help users to unlock their full coding potential and create a more inclusive programming community. Thank you for choosing WokeScript, the most empowering programming language on the planet.
